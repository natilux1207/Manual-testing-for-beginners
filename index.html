    <h4>What is Software Testing?</h4>
    <p>Software Testing is a method to check whether the 
    actual software product matches expected requirements (which are commonly given by the client or 
    product owner to project managers) and to ensure that software product is Defect free. It involves execution of 
    software/system components using manual or automated tools to evaluate one 
    or more properties of interest. The purpose of software testing is to identify errors, 
    gaps or missing requirements in contrast to actual requirements.</p>
