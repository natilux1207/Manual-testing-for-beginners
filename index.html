    <h1>MANUAL TESTING COURSE</h1>
    <h2>From beginner to advanced</h2>
    <h3>Preliminary concepts</h3>
    <h4>What is Software Testing?</h4>
    <p>Software Testing is a method to check whether the 
    actual software product matches expected requirements (which are commonly given by the client or 
    product owner to project managers) and to ensure that software product is Defect free. It involves execution of 
    software/system components using manual or automated tools to evaluate one 
    or more properties of interest. The purpose of software testing is to identify errors, 
    gaps or missing requirements in contrast to actual requirements.
    Software Testing is important because if there are any bugs or errors in the software, it can be 
    identified early and can be solved before delivery of the software product. 
    Properly tested software product ensures reliability, security and high performance
     which further results in time saving, cost effectiveness and customer satisfaction.  
     What is more, software bugs could be expensive or even dangerous. Software bugs can potentially
      cause monetary and human loss. Let's see these few examples:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Starbucks was forced to close about 60 percent of stores in the U.S and Canada due to software 
        failure in its POS system. At one point, the store served coffee for free as they were unable to 
        process the transaction.</li>
    <li>In 2015 fighter plane F-35 fell victim to a software bug, making it unable to detect targets 
        correctly.</li>
    <li>In May of 1996, a software bug caused the bank accounts of 823 customers of a major U.S. 
        bank to be credited with 920 million US dollars.</li>
</ul>
<h4>What are the benefits of Software Testing?</h4>
<p>Here are some important benefits:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Cost-Effective: It is one of the important advantages of software testing. Testing any IT project 
        on time helps you to save your money for the long term. In case if the bugs caught in the earlier 
        stage of software testing, it costs less to fix.</li>
    <li>Security: It is the most vulnerable and sensitive benefit of software testing. People are looking 
        for trusted products. It helps in removing risks and problems earlier.</li>
    <li>Product quality: It is an essential requirement of any software product. Testing ensures a quality 
        product is delivered to customers.</li>
    <li>Customer Satisfaction: The main aim of any product is to give satisfaction to their customers. UI/UX 
        Testing ensures the best user experience.</li>
</ul>
<h4>What's the difference between Quality Assurance (QA), Quality Control (QC), and testing?</h4>
<p>QA is the process of planification and definition about the ways of monitoring and implementing testing 
    inside a particular team or organization, in order to guarantee the product or project's quality. This method
    defines and establishes quality standards for the projects.
    QC is the process of finding defects and giving suggestions to improve the software quality. The methods 
    QC resorts to are generally established to guarantee quality through testing.
    Finally, testing is the process of validating if the software created by the developers' team matches the
    requirements and standars established by the organization.</p>
    <h4>What are "requirements"?</h4>
    <p>Testers' obligation is to analyse requirements. These are the technological needs an organisation has.
        In other words, these are the conditions the system has to comply in order to satisfy the clients' needs.
        These requirements are key for testers to define test cases.
        Test cases are the conditions or variables under which a tester determines if a piece of testing (application,
        program, website, banner, etc) or a function in the piece (clicktags, transitions, animation, etc.) is 
        satisfactory. Let's put it simpler, test cases are the guides or standards used to determine if a piece of testing 
        works correctly (as expected) or not.

<p>Now that we have an idea about some preliminary notions about testing, let's start making the disctinction 
    between the two main types of software testing:
    <ol>
        <li>Manual Testing</li>
        <li>Automation Testing</li>
    </ol>
